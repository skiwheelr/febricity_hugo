* Make screening a part of your medical/security plan so your designated alert contact knows what do when information is received.
\
* Come up with a strategy for handling people who demonstrate indicators of high skin temperature. Ask a series of brief questions. (have you taken any medications or participated in any physical activities that may have impacted your indicated temperature?)
\
* Come up with a strategy for what happens if secondary diagnosis by medical staff determines that person is positive for a virus. (Are they asked to leave? Are they given an info packet on disease prevention and allowed in? Are they given the option of entry with an alternate-color wristband for the day to hold them accountable in maintaining their distance to fellow guests?)
\
* These are just ideas, consult with your licensed legal and medical professionals before establishing a strategy.
